# ONE OK ROCK – Let Me Let You Go

> **歌詞登録ステータス：プレーン歌詞のみ**

```
Why’d you let me let you go?
Bullets in the dark
Shooting through
my hesitating heart
We were never gonna go far
‘Cause I’m no good at loving
Someone else good as you
Look what I put you through
I know I can’t undo this
I’m black and blue
to tell the truth
It’s breaking me,
I’m not just losing you
I’m losing what you saw in me
Why’d you let me let you go?
I can’t breathe
without you here
I wish you’d
never watch me leave
Why’d you let me let you go?
Oh, go
Why’d you let me let you go?
嫌って
一言も言えなくて
何も伝えらなくて
君はもういないけど
けど今なら言える
気づくのは遅すぎる
こんな僕を許して
I’m black and blue
to tell the truth
It’s breaking me,
I’m not just losing you
I’m losing what you saw in me
Why’d you let me let you go?
I can’t breathe
without you here
I wish you’d
never watch me leave
Why’d you let me let you go?
Oh, go
Why’d you let me let you go?
I tried, I tried to love you
I swear I tried
But how can I love you
if you’re not here?
I tried, I tried to love you
I swear I tried
I tried, I tried to love
It’s breaking me,
I’m not just losing you
I’m losing what you saw in me
Why’d you let me let you go?
I can’t breathe
without you here
I wish you’d never
watch me leave
Why’d you let me let you go?
Oh, go
Why’d you let me let you go?
Oh, go
Why’d you let me let you go?
Oh
