Tying ropes around both of our hearts
So they can never part
Bruising for a beautiful thing
Love is an invisible string

Blue hearts don't have space to beat
They wither from indigo to grey
Feeling numb our tourniquet is
Crushing my chest in night and day

Oh oh oh
Oh oh oh
Oh oh oh
Oh oh

Won't you let me let me let you go
Won't you let me let me let me go
Won't you let me let me let you go
Won't you let me let me let me go

Sunstroke on a cloudy day
It's looming as the air it slips away
Monsters on a walk around the park
The days are always dark

Oh oh oh
Oh oh oh
Oh oh oh
Oh oh

Won't you let me let me let you go
Won't you let me let me let me go
Won't you let me let me let you go
Won't you let me let me let me go

Untie the unbreakable bond
The heartbeat on my fingertips though I am feeling numb
Cut lose our strings are all bent
This lovely sleep paralysis must soon come to an end
