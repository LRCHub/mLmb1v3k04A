Girl, oh
Girl
Why'd you let me let you go?
Bullets in the dark
Shooting through my hesitating heart
We were never gonna go far
'Cause I'm no good at loving, someone else good as you
Look what I put you through
I know I can't undo this
I'm black and blue to tell the truth
It's breaking me
I'm not just losing you, I'm losing what you saw in me
Why'd you let me let you go?
I can't breathe without you here
I wish you'd never watch me leave
Why'd you let me let you go? Oh, go
Why'd you let me let you go?
強がって
一言も言えなくて
何も伝えらなくて
君はもういないけど今なら言える
気づくのは遅すぎる
こんな僕を許して
I'm black and blue to tell the truth
It's breaking me
I'm not just losing you, I'm losing what you saw in me
Why'd you let me let you go?
I can't breathe without you here
I wish you'd never watch me leave
Why'd you let me let you go? Oh, go
Why'd you let me let you go?
I tried, I tried to love you
I swear, I tried
But how can I love you if you're not here?
I tried, I tried to love you
I swear, I tried
I tried, I tried to love
It's breaking me
君を失った僕はどうしたらいい?
Why'd you let me let you go?
I can't breathe 他は何もいらない
君だけでいい
Why'd you let me let you go? Oh, go
Why'd you let me let you go? Oh, go
Why'd you let me let you go? Oh
